## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/M5StickCPlus2-Sterzo.git
cd M5StickCPlus2-Sterzo

# Build and upload
pio run --target upload

# Monitor serial output (optional)
pio device monitor
```

### Dependencies
All dependencies are automatically managed by PlatformIO:
- `M5Unified` - M5StickCPlus2 hardware abstraction
- `ESP32 BLE Arduino` - Bluetooth Low Energy support
- `Preferences` - Non-volatile storage
- `Madgwick` - AHRS algorithm library (unused, kept for compatibility)

## 🎮 Usage

### First Time Setup
1. **Power On** - Device performs automatic calibration on first boot
2. **Zwift Pairing** - Open Zwift → Settings → Connections → Search for "STERZO"
3. **Calibration** - Hold Button A or B for 2-3 seconds for manual calibration if needed

### Normal Operation
1. **Mount Device** - Attach to handlebars or hold in hand
2. **Connect to Zwift** - Device advertises as "STERZO" 
3. **Steering Range** - ±40° physical rotation = full Zwift steering
4. **Auto-Centering** - Device gradually returns to center when not actively steering

### Power Management
- **Active Use** - Full performance during Zwift sessions
- **Idle Mode** - Automatic power reduction after 30 seconds
- **Sleep Mode** - Enters sleep after 120 seconds of no motion (when BLE disconnected)

- **Full Calibration** - Long press Button A (2s) or Button B (3s)
- **Progress Feedback** - Visual progress bars and audio beeps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device not connecting to Zwift:**
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your device
- Restart Zwift and search for "STERZO" in connections
- Try power cycling the M5StickCPlus2

**Steering feels unstable:**
- Perform full calibration (long press Button A or B)
- Ensure device is mounted securely
- Check battery level (low battery affects performance)

**Device goes to sleep too quickly:**
- Motion detection requires actual movement/rotation
- BLE connection prevents sleep mode
- Adjust `MOTION_SLEEP_TIMEOUT` in code if needed

**Yaw drift over time:**
- Built-in drift compensation should handle minor drift
- Perform quick recenter (short press Button A or B)
- Full recalibration may be needed for major drift

### Debug Information
Enable serial monitoring to see detailed debug output:
```bash
pio device monitor
```

Debug output includes:
- IMU readings and frequencies
- Power management status
- BLE connection events
- Calibration progress
- Button press detection

## 🔋 Battery Optimization Tips

1. **Use during Zwift sessions only** - Device sleeps when not connected
2. **Regular charging** - Don't let battery fully discharge
3. **Stable mounting** - Reduces unnecessary motion detection
4. **Firmware updates** - Keep firmware updated for latest power optimizations
